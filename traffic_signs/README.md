Esample code:

 - Use traffic_sign_detection.py as a template for your code. This functions shows hot to use the evaluation functions.

 - Use test_submission.py to test your results submissions to the course server

 - Useful resources:

       - Evaluation (Precision, recall, etc.): evaluation/

 - virtualenvs.txt contains instructions to set up a virtualenv if you want to work in the server.
   This allows installing your own set of python packages in a seperate environment using pip.
